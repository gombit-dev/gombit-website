# Migration safety manifest

A **migration safety manifest** classifies whether a migration destroys data,
and a **verifier** proves that classification matches the migration's actual
SQL. A deployment host (a container platform, CI, or
[Gombit Cloud](https://github.com/gombit-dev/gombit/blob/main/docs/adr/015-host-deployment-contracts.md)) uses it to **gate
destructive migrations** without blindly trusting a declared safety field. It is
the HOST-3 contract from [ADR-015](https://github.com/gombit-dev/gombit/blob/main/docs/adr/015-host-deployment-contracts.md).

```bash
gombit db verify            # classify each migration; verify existing manifests
gombit db verify --write    # write a manifest beside each migration
gombit db verify --json     # print each migration's classification (for a host)
gombit db verify --strict   # also exit non-zero if any migration loses data
```

`gombit db verify` classifies migrations that are already written, for a
deployment host. For CI, [`gombit db lint`](/guide/migrations#linting-and-repairing-the-migration-directory)
classifies them structurally (the schema before and after each one) and with
this statement classifier, and fails on a destructive or unsafe change the
migration does not acknowledge with a `-- gombit:allow` line. To see
what the *next* migration would do before it exists, including changes a
statement-level reading cannot see (a NOT NULL column added to a populated
table, a foreign key delete rule inside a SQLite table rebuild), use
[`gombit db plan`](/guide/migrations#planning-a-change).

## What it classifies

`gombit db verify` reads each `database/migrations/*.sql` file, strips comments,
and classifies every statement into a closed set of operations, flagging those
that lose data:

| Operation | Safety |
| --- | --- |
| `create_table`, `add_column`, `create_index`, `drop_index`, `rename_table`, `rename_column` | `non_destructive` |
| `drop_column`, `drop_table`, `alter_column`, `DELETE` / `TRUNCATE` (as `other`) | **`data_loss`** |

A migration with any `data_loss` operation sets `requires_confirmation: true`.
It is a statement-level DDL classifier, not a full SQL parser, and it is
**fail-safe**: only statements it positively recognizes as additive or metadata
(create table/index/view, add column, insert, grant, …) are `non_destructive`.
Everything else — `UPDATE`, `TRUNCATE`, any `DELETE` (including MySQL
multi-table `DELETE t FROM …`), `DROP SCHEMA`/`DROP DATABASE`, every
`alter_column` (widening or narrowing), and any statement it cannot parse — classifies as `data_loss`
so a host reviews it. It handles the Postgres (`"`), MySQL (`` ` ``) and SQLite
quoting Atlas emits; where SQLite rewrites a drop-column as a table rebuild, the
old-table `DROP` still flags data loss, and a multi-action `ALTER`
(`ADD a, DROP b`) still surfaces the drop.

## The manifest

`--write` emits `<version>_<name>.manifest.json` beside each migration:

```json
{
  "manifest_version": 1,
  "migration": { "version": "20260901120000", "name": "drop_legacy_code" },
  "sql_sha256": "…",
  "requires_confirmation": true,
  "operations": [
    { "kind": "drop_column", "resource": "customers", "column": "legacy_code", "safety": "data_loss" }
  ]
}
```

`sql_sha256` binds the manifest to the exact reviewed SQL. It is **anti-tamper**
binding, not migration drift detection (build plan D4 keeps
`framework_migrations` checksum-free); the manifest never touches that table.

## Verify, don't trust

Without `--write`, `gombit db verify` checks each migration that has a manifest
against its SQL and **fails** (non-zero exit) when:

- **the SQL changed after review** — `sql_sha256` no longer matches; or
- **the manifest lies** — it declares `non_destructive` while the SQL drops a
  column, or otherwise disagrees with what the SQL actually does.

So a host never trusts a manifest's own `safety` field — it re-derives the
classification from the executable SQL and compares (DESIGN.md §31).

## Gombit classifies; the host gates

Gombit **classifies and verifies**. It does **not** implement the approval
workflow: blocking a `data_loss` migration until a human confirms it is the
host's policy (DESIGN.md §32), and automation must never silently auto-confirm
data loss (§33).

Two exit behaviors give a host what it needs:

- Plain `gombit db verify` exits non-zero only on a **verification failure**
  (hash or classification mismatch) — a correctly classified, honestly declared
  data-loss migration exits `0`.
- `gombit db verify --strict` **additionally** exits non-zero when any migration
  requires confirmation, so a host or CI can gate on the exit code alone.

A host can equivalently read `requires_confirmation` from `--json`. See
[ADR-015](https://github.com/gombit-dev/gombit/blob/main/docs/adr/015-host-deployment-contracts.md).
