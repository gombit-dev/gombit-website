# Gombit CLI

`gombit` is a Cobra command tree (D13 / [ADR-014](https://github.com/gombit-dev/gombit/blob/main/docs/adr/014-cli-cobra.md)).
Root help lists the command families. Nested families and app-registered
management commands attach with Cobra `AddCommand` (or `cli.AddCommand`,
a thin wrapper). There is no second command router and no reflection
discovery of commands.

The framework binary is `go run ./cmd/gombit` in this repository. Generated
apps get their own `cmd/gombit` that reuses `cli.NewRoot` and then calls
`product.RegisterCommands(root)` (and any `internal/commands.RegisterCommands`).
App-owned commands are discoverable via `go run ./cmd/gombit` from the
application module.

```sh
go run ./cmd/gombit --help
```

## Generator golden tests

`goldentest` runs each generator against a fixed, non-interactive fixture,
diffs the output tree against `goldentest/testdata/golden`, compiles the
generated backend (`go build` with a local `replace` in a temp copy — never
committed), typechecks the frontend with `npx tsc --noEmit` when Node is
on `PATH` (`t.Skip` otherwise), and checks that a second run is idempotent
(`gombit new --force`, `make resource` without `--force`, `make command`
without `--force`, `client generate` without `--force`). Atlas is not
invoked, so migration filenames stay out of the trees.

```sh
go test ./goldentest
go test ./goldentest -update   # regenerate committed goldens
```

CI picks this up via `go test ./...`. Do not commit `replace` directives or
machine-specific paths in the goldens.

## `gombit new`

Non-interactive (the acceptance criterion):

```sh
gombit new demo --database sqlite
```

That writes a compiling app under `./demo`. The default Go module path is
`github.com/example/demo`. Override it with `--module`.

```sh
cd demo
go run ./cmd/server
```

No `go get` step: the generated `go.mod` requires **the same gombit version as
the binary that scaffolded it**, and `gombit new` then runs `go mod tidy` to
populate `go.sum`. An installed release therefore produces a tree that builds
immediately.

Once `go mod tidy` succeeds, `gombit new` also seeds an initial `bootstrap`
migration under `database/migrations/` for the framework's own auth tables,
and applies it immediately for `--database sqlite` (the default) —
`db status` shows it applied before you've run `db migrate` yourself.
Requires Atlas on `PATH`; prints the equivalent `gombit db makemigrations` /
`gombit db migrate` command instead of failing when it isn't (or when the
driver isn't sqlite yet). See
[migrations.md](/guide/migrations#the-bootstrap-migration) for why this exists.

Version resolution follows `gombit version` (see below) and falls back to
`v0.0.0` — which the proxy cannot resolve — when the CLI reports something
unpublishable:

| CLI build | Requirement written | Tidy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Release binary (ldflags) | that tag, e.g. `v0.1.0` | runs |
| `go install ...@latest` | the module version, e.g. a pseudo-version | runs |
| `go build` / `go run` from a checkout (`dev`, `+dirty`) | `v0.0.0` | skipped |
| `--framework-version vX.Y.Z` | that version | runs |

In the fallback case the command prints why, and the app needs a replace
pointing at your checkout (never commit a machine-specific path):

```sh
cd demo
go mod edit -replace github.com/gombit-dev/gombit=/path/to/gombit
go mod tidy
```

### Flags

| Flag | Values | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--database` | `sqlite`, `postgres`, `mysql` | `sqlite` |
| `--cache` | `memory`, `redis`, `noop` | `memory` |
| `--auth` | `jwt`, `cookie` | `jwt` |
| `--ui` | `minimal`, `mui` | `minimal` |
| `--module` | Go module path | `github.com/example/<name>` |
| `--framework-version` | gombit version the generated `go.mod` requires | this binary's version |
| `--skip-tidy` | | do not run `go mod tidy` (offline); also skips seeding the bootstrap migration, which needs a tidied module |
| `--dry-run` | | print the file list without writing |
| `--force` | | required to write into a non-empty destination |

`--auth cookie` wires HttpOnly session cookies + CSRF end to end (backend
routes, middleware, and the generated frontend); see
[auth-cookie.md](/guide/authentication-cookie) for the threat model. `--ui mui` scaffolds
the opt-in MUI CRUD preset (ThemeProvider, AppBar, Table, TextField);
the default UI stays minimal/headless. See [frontend-mui.md](/guide/frontend-mui).
The generated `frontend/` directory is a Vite + React + TypeScript skeleton
(router, generated client, React Hook Form). Bearer login is documented in
[auth.md](/guide/authentication). See [frontend.md](/guide/frontend).

If the project name is omitted and stdin is a TTY, `gombit new` prompts for
name and the choices above. Tests and CI pass flags so the command never
hangs.

Generators are additive: `--dry-run` writes nothing; a non-empty destination
is refused unless `--force` is set. `--force` overwrites scaffold files and
leaves other files in the destination alone.

### Layout

The scaffold matches build plan §3.2:

```
demo/
├── cmd/server/main.go
├── cmd/gombit/main.go    # framework tree + product.RegisterCommands
├── internal/
│   ├── platform/
│   ├── product/          # model, handler.go, routes.go, commands.go
│   └── web/              # go:embed hook (static/.keep placeholder; no index.html)
├── database/migrations/  # a bootstrap_*.sql migration + models.json are seeded (and, for sqlite, applied) here
├── database/seeds/
├── config/

├── .env.example
├── go.mod
└── README.md
```

`cmd/server/main.go` calls `config.Load()`, `framework.New` (including
`framework.WithEmbeddedFrontend`), registers `internal/product` routes
explicitly (no reflection), and `framework.Run`. The placeholder embed has
no `index.html`, so `go run ./cmd/server` after `gombit new` does not
install SPA fallback. See [build.md](/guide/deployment) for `gombit build --embed`.
`cmd/gombit/main.go` calls `cli.NewRoot`, `product.RegisterCommands(root)`,
and `cli.ExecuteRoot`. Public product routes are Huma-typed under `/api/v1`.
There is no generated `service.go` or `repo.go` until
`gombit make resource --service` / `--repo`.

`.env.example` lists `GOMBIT_*` server variables from the `config` package
and public `VITE_API_URL` (empty means same-origin for the Vite `/api`
proxy). `VITE_*` is baked into the browser bundle — never put secrets there.
Access tokens stay in memory; generated source does not use `localStorage`.

## `gombit dev`

From an application directory (the output of `gombit new`):

```sh
gombit dev
```

One command starts:

1. The Go API with reload when `air` or `watchexec` is on `PATH`. If neither
   is installed, Gombit runs `go run ./cmd/server` and prints a hint.
2. The Vite frontend with HMR (`pnpm` when available, otherwise `npm`). Vite
   proxies `/api`, `/openapi.json`, `/docs`, and `/admin` to the Go origin.
   Prefixes that do not start with `/api` get an extra proxy entry from the live
   `GOMBIT_API_PREFIX`.
3. An OpenAPI watcher that regenerates `frontend/src/api/generated` when the
   live `/openapi.json` document changes (`gombit client generate`).

A service table is printed at startup:

```text
Backend      http://127.0.0.1:8080
Frontend     http://127.0.0.1:5173
OpenAPI      http://127.0.0.1:8080/openapi.json
API docs     http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs
```

Cookie-mode apps also print the admin SPA (the same origin the Vite `/admin`
proxy forwards to):

```text
Admin        http://127.0.0.1:8080/admin/
```

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--http` | `GOMBIT_HTTP_ADDR` or `:8080` | Go API listen address |
| `--frontend-host` | `127.0.0.1` | Vite bind host |
| `--frontend-port` | `5173` | Vite port |
| `--client-out` | `frontend/src/api/generated` | TypeScript client output |
| `--poll` | `1s` | OpenAPI poll interval |

`frontend/package.json` is required. A missing file is an error — backend-only
mode is not supported. Node.js is required for Vite.

`--http` and the Vite proxy origin are written into the child environment
(`GOMBIT_HTTP_ADDR`, `GOMBIT_DEV_BACKEND`, `GOMBIT_API_PREFIX`,
`VITE_API_URL=`), replacing any parent values so a shell-exported
`.env.example` cannot keep the API on `:8080` while the service table
prints `--http :9090`. Empty `VITE_API_URL` is same-origin so OpenAPI
path keys such as `/api/v1/products` hit the Vite proxy; `createAppClient`
rewrites them to the live `GOMBIT_API_PREFIX`. Vite replaces
`__GOMBIT_API_PREFIX__` in `index.html` during `vite dev`. Production
Vite builds leave the placeholder so `gombit build --embed` can inject
it; a split/CDN host must substitute that token itself.

SIGINT/SIGTERM stops the child processes. On Unix, Gombit signals the process
group so air/npm grandchildren exit. On Windows, teardown uses
`taskkill /T /F /PID` for the same process tree.

The scaffold is a Vite + React + TypeScript skeleton. See
[frontend.md](/guide/frontend). `--ui mui` is documented in
[frontend-mui.md](/guide/frontend-mui). Bearer login is documented in
[auth.md](/guide/authentication). Split deploy is the default; production embed is
[`gombit build --embed`](#gombit-build---embed).

## `gombit build --embed`

From an application directory (the output of `gombit new`):

```sh
gombit build --embed
gombit build --embed --out bin/server
gombit build --embed --dry-run
```

Split deploy is the default (C5). A bare `gombit build` without `--embed`
is an error — it does not silently switch production to a single binary.

`--embed` runs the Django `collectstatic` equivalent folded into the
production build:

1. Require `frontend/package.json` (same class of error as `gombit dev`).
2. Vite production build in `frontend/` (`pnpm` when available or when
   `frontend/pnpm-lock.yaml` exists, otherwise `npm run build`).
3. Copy `frontend/dist` → `internal/web/static` (replace previous assets;
   do not delete `internal/web/embed.go`). Fail if `frontend/dist/index.html`
   is missing after the Vite build.
4. `go build ./cmd/server` to `--out` (default `bin/server`).

The compiled binary serves Huma `/api/*`, `/openapi.json`, `/docs`,
`/livez`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`, real files from the embed FS, and
`index.html` for unmatched GET frontend routes (`/`, `/login`,
`/products/new`). Non-GET unmatched routes stay 404. See
[build.md](/guide/deployment).

### Flags

| Flag | Default | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--embed` | off (required to run this command; split deploy stays the default) | Opt in to collectstatic + `go:embed` |
| `--out` | `bin/server` | Output binary path |
| `--dry-run` | | Print the plan without writing or compiling |

`frontend/package.json` is required. `--dry-run` writes nothing.

## `gombit make resource`

From an application directory (the output of `gombit new`):

```sh
gombit make resource Widget name:string:required price:int
gombit make resource Invoice --service --repo --dry-run
gombit make resource Widget --force
```

`make` is a Cobra parent (`AddCommand`); `resource` is the subcommand. Root
help lists `make`.

This writes a feature-package under `internal/<snake>/`:

| File | When |
| --- | --- |
| `<snake>.go` | GORM model (`gorm.Model` + fields) |
| `handler.go` | Thin Huma list/get/create over GORM (D10 envelope; list honors `page`/`per_page`; get/create map missing rows to `not_found` and unique violations to `conflict`) |
| `routes.go` | `Register(app *framework.App)` |
| `service.go` | Only with `--service` (pass-through) |
| `repo.go` | Only with `--repo` (pass-through) |

Default API prefix is `/api/v1`. The handler stays thin over GORM; `--service`
and `--repo` are C6 opt-in and are not used by the generated handler.

Route registration is appended in `cmd/server/main.go` via `go/ast` +
`go/parser` + `go/format` (never regex), next to `product.Register(app)`.
`internal/platform` AutoMigrate is updated the same way. Re-running does not
duplicate the `Register` call. A second resource whose plural HTTP path
collides with an existing feature-package (`Bus` and `Buse` both become
`/buses`) is refused. `Product` is reserved: every `gombit new` app already
owns `internal/product` and the `/products` SPA routes (same as
`make command --package product`). The module path is read from `go.mod` with trailing
`//` comments stripped, so `module example.com/demo // app` does not leak
into generated imports.

Frontend pages are React + TypeScript (list/table + React Hook Form create)
under `frontend/src/<feature>/`. They import types from
`frontend/src/api/generated` — no hand-written API DTOs — and map D10
`error.fields` through `frontend/src/api/formErrors.ts`. Integer fields
coerce a cleared number input to `0` (`setValueAs`), not JSON `null`. A generated
`frontend/src/resources.tsx` registry is the React Router registration
point (not regex-patched `main.tsx`). When `gombit.yaml` has `ui: mui`,
list/form pages use MUI Table and TextField instead of raw HTML. Generated
list/form OpenAPI path keys stay `/api/v1/<resource>`; `createAppClient`
rewrites them to the live `GOMBIT_API_PREFIX` (same as the product pages).

After generating routes, run `gombit client generate` or `gombit dev` so
`frontend/src/api/generated` includes the new paths.

### Field grammar

Design §27 subset:

```text
name:type[:required][,unique][,index]
```

Supported types: `string`, `text`, `int`, `int64`, `bool`, `uint`, `decimal`,
`time`, `enum`. Unknown types error with the supported list. `nullable` is
accepted as the opposite of `required`.

| Type | Go type | Column / contract |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `decimal` | `types.Decimal` (wraps `shopspring/decimal`) | `decimal(19,4)`; JSON string, exact — no float rounding |
| `decimal(p,s)` | `types.Decimal` | `decimal(p,s)`, e.g. `decimal(10,2)` |
| `time` | `time.Time` | RFC3339 date-time in JSON |
| `enum(a,b,c)` | `string` | sized varchar; validated against the listed values (Huma `enum` tag) |
| `belongs_to:Target` | FK `TargetID uint` + `Target target.Target` | DTO exposes `target_id`; admin renders a picker |
| `has_many:Target` | `[]target.Target` | model-only, read via the admin; the child must carry the parent FK |
| `many_to_many:Target` | `[]target.Target` (`many2many:` join) | model-only, edited via the admin |

`types.Decimal` is the framework money/decimal type. Because a single Go type
flows through the model, the handler DTO, the OpenAPI/TS contract, and GORM,
adding one of these types does not reproduce the model/DTO drift of
[#218](https://github.com/gombit-dev/gombit/issues/218). A `time` or `decimal`
field **without** `:required` becomes a pointer (`*time.Time` / `*types.Decimal`)
on the model and DTO, because those value types cannot be submitted empty — the
generated forms send `null` for a blank optional value. Enum values are
case-sensitive and validated at the API layer; no database CHECK constraint is
added (portable across SQLite/PostgreSQL/MySQL).

**Relations** use `name:kind:Target`, where `Target` is a model in
`internal/<target>/` (imported as `target.Target`). `belongs_to` generates the
foreign key (`EngineID uint`) plus the association and exposes `engine_id` in
the REST DTO; `has_many` and `many_to_many` generate the association on the model
(the join table for m2m), not in the thin REST handler. In the admin,
`many_to_many` is editable through a relation widget and `has_many` is shown
read-only. A `has_many` child model must carry the parent foreign key itself
(e.g. `RentalID`); the generator does not edit the child (that would be an
import cycle).

Self-referential relations (a target equal to the resource itself, e.g.
`parent:belongs_to:Category` on `Category`) are not supported yet and are
rejected at parse time: a self-referential `belongs_to` needs a nullable foreign
key so a tree root stores `NULL` rather than `0` (which references no row and
fails the self-FK), and `has_many` / `many_to_many` onto the same model need
explicit join keys. Point relations at a different feature-package for now.

Example:

```sh
gombit make resource Rental \
  price:decimal:required \
  starts_at:time \
  status:enum(requested,confirmed,active,returned,cancelled) \
  engine:belongs_to:Engine \
  warehouses:many_to_many:Warehouse
```

### Idempotency

Generators print created/modified files. `--dry-run` writes nothing.
Identical re-runs are no-ops. A user-owned file (no generated banner) or a
generated file that differs from this run is refused unless `--force`.
`frontend/src/resources.tsx` is the exception: it is always rewritten as a
scanned registry of generated feature pages (banner present), so edits to
that file are not preserved.

### Migrations

Gombit does not invent a migration DSL. The generated GORM model is
Atlas-loader ready. If the `atlas` binary is on `PATH`, `make resource`
attempts `migrations.MakeMigrations` with every `&pkg.Type{}` already
registered in `internal/platform` AutoMigrate plus the new model, merged with
`database/migrations/models.json` (see
[migrations.md](/guide/migrations#generate-a-migration)) — so a model that isn't
in the `AutoMigrate` list for some reason but is still tracked in the
registry isn't dropped either. If Atlas is missing from `PATH`, SQL is
skipped and the command prints:

```sh
gombit db makemigrations create_books \
  --model github.com/example/demo/internal/product.Product \
  --model github.com/example/demo/internal/book.Book
```

See [migrations.md](/guide/migrations).

## `gombit make command`

From an application directory (the output of `gombit new`):

```sh
gombit make command greet
gombit make command hello --package hello --dry-run
gombit make command greet --force
```

`make` is a Cobra parent; `command` is the subcommand. This writes a
feature-package management command and registers it on the **app-owned**
`cmd/gombit` tree — not the framework binary
(`go run github.com/gombit-dev/gombit/cmd/gombit`).
The generator requires a `gombit new` app (`cmd/server/main.go` and/or
`gombit.yaml`) and refuses a framework-shaped tree so it cannot rewrite
the framework `cmd/gombit/main.go`.

Default package is `internal/commands`. `--package hello` writes
`internal/hello/` instead. Files:

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `internal/<pkg>/<name>.go` | `New<Name>Command() *cli.Command` |
| `internal/<pkg>/commands.go` | `RegisterCommands(root *cli.Command)` calling `cli.AddCommand` |
| `cmd/gombit/main.go` | AST-appends `<pkg>.RegisterCommands(root)` next to `product.RegisterCommands(root)` |

The module path is read from `go.mod` with trailing `//` comments stripped
(same as `make resource`).

`cli.AddCommand` is a thin wrapper around Cobra `AddCommand` (D13 /
[ADR-014](https://github.com/gombit-dev/gombit/blob/main/docs/adr/014-cli-cobra.md)). Generated apps do not invent a second
router and do not discover commands by reflection.

After generating:

```sh
go run ./cmd/gombit greet
go run ./cmd/gombit --help
```

Registration edits use `go/ast` + `go/parser` + `go/format` (never regex).
`--dry-run` writes nothing. Re-running does not duplicate `RegisterCommands` or
`AddCommand` calls. A generated command file that differs from this run
(or a user-owned file) is refused unless `--force`. `commands.go` and
`cmd/gombit/main.go` are additive AST edits of known registration points.

Command names that collide with framework families (`new`, `dev`, `build`,
`make`, `db`, `openapi`, `client`, `routes`, `doctor`, `config`,
`createsuperuser`, `version`, `help`, `completion`) are rejected.

## `gombit db`

Same subcommands and flags as M2, now on Cobra:

```sh
gombit db makemigrations create_products --model github.com/example/demo/internal/product.Product
gombit db migrate
gombit db rollback
gombit db status
gombit db seed
gombit db reset [--force]
```

See [migrations.md](/guide/migrations) for Atlas behavior.

## `gombit routes`

Print a table of HTTP method and path:

```sh
gombit routes
gombit routes --url http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

Default listing constructs an in-process `framework.App` (memory cache, docs
on) and prints framework-owned routes: `/livez`, `/readyz`, `/metrics`,
`/openapi.json` (and Huma siblings), and `/docs`. Application feature routes
are registered by the app; they are not discovered by reflection. Against a
running server, `--url` fetches `/openapi.json` and lists the live contract
paths (probes and other raw Gin routes stay out of that spec).

## `gombit doctor`

```sh
gombit doctor
gombit doctor --dir database/migrations
```

Prints a status table. A `FAIL` row exits non-zero.

| Check | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `go` | `go version` on `PATH` |
| `node` | `node --version`; **warn** if missing (`gombit dev` needs it) |
| `config` | `config.Load()` / `FieldErrors` |
| `database` | `database.Open` + ping when a driver/DSN is set (timeout-bounded) |
| `redis` | ping when `GOMBIT_CACHE_DRIVER=redis` (timeout-bounded) |
| `migrations` | pending Atlas SQL in `--dir` (**warn**); skip if the directory is absent |
| `http` | `GOMBIT_HTTP_ADDR` parses; **warn** if the port is in use |
| `insecure` | production `/docs`, unwritable SQLite path, production JWT secret shorter than 32 characters or equal to the generated-app development placeholder |

Network checks use a short timeout so CI cannot hang. Doctor does not start
Postgres/Redis containers; an invalid driver, broken `config.Load()`, or an
unwritable SQLite path is enough to flag a deliberately-broken config.

Appendix C rejects a production JWT secret shorter than 32 characters, and
the generated-app development placeholder, on the `config` row
(`config.Load`) and the `insecure` row when config is stubbed past Load. Cookie `Secure` and CORS+credentials checks wait for
M5-3. Production trusted-proxy and Redis `TLSInsecure` rejections already
live in `config.Validate()` and show up on the `config` row.

## `gombit config show`

```sh
gombit config show
```

Prints the typed `config.Load()` result as aligned `key<TAB>value` lines.
Database DSN userinfo/passwords, `Cache.Redis.Password`, and
`Auth.JWTSecret` are replaced with `*****` and must never appear in the
output.

See [config.md](/guide/configuration).

## `gombit createsuperuser`

```sh
gombit createsuperuser --email admin@example.com --password correct-horse-battery-staple
gombit createsuperuser --no-input --email admin@example.com --password correct-horse-battery-staple
gombit createsuperuser
```

Django `createsuperuser` → `gombit createsuperuser` (M4-6). It seeds an
admin account against the same `auth` users table as `POST /auth/register`,
using the same `auth.Service` bcrypt hasher — there is no second hash path.

Requires `GOMBIT_JWT_SECRET` to be set (`cfg.Auth.Enabled()`): without it
Bearer auth is unmounted by `framework.New`, so a superuser could never log
in. It loads config with `config.Load`, opens the database with
`database.Open`, then calls `auth.Service.CreateSuperuser`.

In development and test, the command runs `auth.Migrate` (GORM AutoMigrate)
so a fresh local DB works before Atlas migrations exist. In production it
never AutoMigrates: schema changes belong to `gombit db migrate`. If the
users table is missing, the command fails and tells you to migrate first.
`CreateSuperuser` shares `Register`'s unique-email path — duplicate emails
are refused with the same error as `/auth/register`.

### Flags

| Flag | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `--email` | Superuser account email |
| `--password` | Superuser account password (prefer the interactive prompt; visible in shell history and process listings when passed as a flag) |
| `--no-input` | Never prompt; require both `--email` and `--password` (use in scripts and tests) |

If `--email` or `--password` is omitted and stdin is a TTY, the command
prompts interactively (password entry is hidden). If stdin is not a TTY (CI,
tests, pipes), the missing flags are a hard error instead of a hang.
`--no-input` skips TTY detection entirely.

`createsuperuser` sets `auth.User.IsSuperuser`; ADMIN-3 treats that flag as
a bypass for all direct and group permission checks. See
[admin.md](/guide/admin).

## `gombit version`

```sh
gombit version
gombit version --short
gombit --version
```

```text
gombit:   v0.1.0
commit:   9abb3c6ecc8c1bf93419aa43c4d4f1ae3de97a2b
built:    2026-08-18T19:33:15Z
go:       go1.25.7
platform: linux/amd64
```

Include this output when filing a bug report — the issue form asks for it.

Version resolution has three tiers, in order:

1. **ldflags.** Release binaries are stamped by
   `.github/workflows/release.yml` with
   `-X github.com/gombit-dev/gombit/cli.Version=<tag>` (plus
   `Commit` and `BuildDate`).
2. **Module build info.** A binary from
   `go install github.com/gombit-dev/gombit/cmd/gombit@v0.1.0`
   carries no ldflags, so the version comes from
   `runtime/debug.ReadBuildInfo()`. `commit` and `built` come from the
   embedded `vcs.revision` / `vcs.time` settings when the build had them.
3. **`dev`.** A local `go run ./cmd/gombit` or a build from a checkout
   reports `dev` rather than Go's `(devel)`, with `unknown` for the fields
   that have no source.

`--short` prints the bare version string and nothing else, which is what you
want in scripts:

```sh
test "$(gombit version --short)" = "v0.1.0"
```
