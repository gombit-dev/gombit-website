# Migrations

M2 introduces `gombit db` migration commands as a thin wrapper around Atlas
versioned migrations and `ariga.io/atlas-provider-gorm` Program Mode. Gombit
does not define its own migration DSL.

## The bootstrap migration

`gombit new` seeds `database/migrations/<timestamp>_bootstrap.sql` (and the
`models.json` registry entry for it — see [Generate A
Migration](#generate-a-migration)) covering every model
`internal/platform/database.go`'s `AutoMigrate` call registers — the
framework's own auth tables (`users`, `permissions`, `groups`,
`refresh_tokens`, their join tables) plus the `product/` example — when Atlas
is on `PATH` and `go mod tidy` succeeded. For `--database sqlite` (the
default), `gombit new` also **applies** it immediately, so
`gombit db status` shows it already applied before you've run `db migrate`
yourself. `--database postgres`/`mysql` get a placeholder DSN until you edit
`.env` with real credentials, so those are seeded but left for you to apply
with `gombit db migrate` once configured — same as always. If Atlas isn't
installed at all, `gombit new` prints the equivalent
`gombit db makemigrations bootstrap --model ...` command to run once it is.

This exists because `AutoMigrate` also runs at every app startup
(`app.OnStart`), creating those tables directly through GORM — including the
very first `gombit dev`, which the tutorial has you start before you ever
touch migrations yourself. Without the bootstrap migration **applied** before
that first run, `AutoMigrate` creates the tables live first, and applying the
migration afterward fails with `table users already exists`. Seeding it
without applying it isn't enough on its own: Atlas's tracked history has to
actually match the live database, not just have a migration file on disk
describing what it should eventually look like.

## Generate A Migration

Run the command from the application module root:

```sh
gombit db makemigrations create_products \
  --driver sqlite \
  --model github.com/acme/shop/internal/product.Product
```

`--driver` defaults to the configured driver (`GOMBIT_DATABASE_DRIVER`, `sqlite`
when unset) and `--dir` to `database/migrations`.

The Atlas Community Edition CLI must be installed and available on `PATH`, or
supplied with `--atlas-bin`:

```sh
curl -sSf https://atlasgo.sh | sh -s -- --community
```

You only need to name what's new. `gombit db makemigrations` persists every
model it's ever seen for a given `--dir` in `database/migrations/models.json`
and merges new `--model` flags into that set — it is not the entire desired
schema by itself, just what this invocation is adding. Adding a second
feature later only needs its own model:

```sh
gombit db makemigrations create_accounts \
  --driver postgres \
  --model github.com/acme/shop/internal/account.Account
```

`product.Product` from the first migration is carried forward automatically;
this does not generate a `DROP TABLE product`. Commit `models.json` alongside
the SQL files it describes — like `atlas.sum`, it's part of the migration
history, not build output. Atlas itself ignores it (only `*.sql` and
`atlas.sum` are meaningful to `atlas migrate diff`/`apply`), and `gombit db
status`/`migrate` skip it the same way they already skip `atlas.sum`.

To retire a model — the table is genuinely going away — say so explicitly
instead of just omitting it, so Atlas proposes the drop on purpose:

```sh
gombit db makemigrations drop_legacy_widget \
  --driver postgres \
  --forget-model github.com/acme/shop/internal/widget.Widget
```

`--forget-model` removes the entry from `models.json` and from this
invocation's desired schema, so the generated migration is the intentional
`DROP TABLE` — the only way to get one, now that the registry means a model
is never dropped by accident just because a later call didn't repeat it.

Retire in this order, or the drop won't stick. `AutoMigrate` in
`internal/platform/database.go` is a second declaration of desired state (the
models the app persists on start), and `gombit make resource` migrates every
model listed there. So `makemigrations` refuses to forget a model that is still
an `AutoMigrate` argument — otherwise the next `make resource` or app start
would silently re-add it:

1. Remove the model from the `AutoMigrate` call in
   `internal/platform/database.go` and delete any routes/resources referencing
   it.
2. `gombit db makemigrations drop_legacy_widget --forget-model <import>.Widget`.
3. `gombit db migrate`.

Forgetting a model that isn't in `models.json` (a typo in the import path, or
one already forgotten) is an error, not a silent no-op — nothing is tracked
under that name, so there is nothing to drop.

The command writes a temporary Atlas Program Mode loader under `.gombit`,
passes all supplied model types to `gormschema.New(driver).Load(...)`, writes
the generated SQL schema to a temporary `schema.sql`, and then runs:

```sh
atlas migrate diff <name> --env gombit --config file://<generated atlas.hcl>
```

The temporary loader is removed after Atlas exits. Migration files are written
to `database/migrations` by default; override that with `--dir`.

`gombit db makemigrations` depends only on Atlas Community Edition features:
the generated config points `src` at the temporary schema file and uses
`atlas migrate diff`, and the [plan](#planning-a-change) uses
`atlas schema inspect`. It does not depend on Atlas Cloud, drift monitoring,
external schema data sources, or `atlas migrate lint`.

If there is no model/schema change, `atlas migrate diff` exits without writing a
new migration. To preview a change before anything is written, use
[`gombit db plan`](#planning-a-change).

Migration names may contain letters, numbers, underscores, and hyphens, and
must not start with a hyphen.

## Planning a change

`gombit db plan` shows what the next `makemigrations` would do, without writing
anything. It takes the same `--driver`, `--dir`, `--atlas-bin`, `--model`, and
`--forget-model` flags:

```sh
gombit db plan --driver sqlite
```

```text
Schema plan (sqlite, 4 change(s)):

  DESTRUCTIVE  drop_column:products.title
               Drops column products.title and the data in it.
               products.name is added in the same plan. If it replaces title, keep the data with a rename instead:
                 gombit db makemigrations <name> --rename products.title:name
  UNSAFE       add_not_null:products.name
               Adds NOT NULL column products.name with no default. The migration fails when products already has rows.
               Give the column a database default (a gorm:"default:..." tag on the model field; Gombit's default= field modifier is applied by the API, not the database, so it does not change this), or add it as nullable, backfill it, and make it required in a later migration.
  UNSAFE       add_not_null:products.price
               Adds NOT NULL column products.price with no default. The migration fails when products already has rows.
               Give the column a database default (a gorm:"default:..." tag on the model field; Gombit's default= field modifier is applied by the API, not the database, so it does not change this), or add it as nullable, backfill it, and make it required in a later migration.
  REVIEW       table_rebuild:products
               SQLite rebuilds products: it copies the rows into new_products, drops products, and renames the copy.

3 destructive or unsafe change(s) need acknowledgement. Handle the data, then pass --allow for each:
  --allow drop_column:products.title
  --allow add_not_null:products.name
  --allow add_not_null:products.price
```

It builds the schema the migration directory produces and the schema the models
declare, both with `atlas schema inspect` on the dev database, and classifies
Atlas's diff between them. Nothing is parsed out of migration SQL. Each change
gets a severity:

| Severity | Meaning | Codes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `destructive` | Loses data | `drop_table`, `drop_column`, `narrow_type` (for example `bigint` to `integer`, `text` to `varchar(100)`) |
| `unsafe` | Can fail on a table that already has rows | `add_not_null` (no default), `set_not_null`, `add_unique` (a new unique index, or a same-named one re-created with new columns), `add_foreign_key` (a new foreign key over existing columns, or a same-named one whose columns or target change), `add_check`, `change_type` with no safe direction, `change_primary_key`, `change_charset` (to anything but `utf8mb4`, or to `utf8mb4` when an index on the column can pass InnoDB's 3072-byte key limit), `change_collation` on a column in a unique key or in a foreign key whose other side keeps another collation, `change_generated`, any MySQL key a step builds (a new table, index, or foreign key, or a column change under an existing key) that can pass InnoDB's 3072-byte limit or indexes TEXT/BLOB without a prefix, `other` (a change Gombit cannot classify fails closed) |
| `review` | Applies, but changes behavior | `change_foreign_key` (only the `ON DELETE` / `ON UPDATE` action, for example `RESTRICT` to `CASCADE`), `drop_foreign_key`, dropping a primary key, `widen_type`, `table_rebuild` (SQLite), `change_charset` to `utf8mb4` when its indexes still fit, `change_collation` on any other column |
| `safe` | Adds structure or relaxes a rule | `add_table`, `add_column`, `add_index`, `drop_not_null`, `change_default`, `change_comment`, table charset/collation/comment options, `rename_index` / `rename_foreign_key` / `rename_check` (dropped and re-added under a new name with an identical definition: columns, order, direction, prefixes, predicate, nulls handling, every attribute; anything stricter is classified as a new constraint), … |

A dropped column next to an added column of the same type family is reported
with the `--rename` command that keeps the data (see
[Renaming a column](#renaming-a-column)). A new unique index or foreign key
over a column added in the same plan is safe only when that column is nullable
and has no default, because every existing row then holds NULL. A default is
written into every existing row first, so the same index can collide and the
same foreign key can point at a missing row. SQLite type changes are `review`, not
`destructive`: SQLite column types are affinities and the rebuild copies every
stored value as it is.

**Acknowledging a change.** A destructive or unsafe step needs an explicit
`--allow`. It takes a step ID (`drop_column:products.title`) or a code
(`add_not_null`, for every step with that code) and is repeatable.
`makemigrations` refuses to keep a migration that contains an unacknowledged
step. It classifies the SQL Atlas generated exactly the way
[`gombit db lint`](#linting-and-repairing-the-migration-directory) will (the
schema diff plus the statements), so what it records and what lint enforces
are one set; a refused migration is removed and `atlas.sum` restored. It prints
the plan and the full command that writes the same migration with every step
acknowledged, including any `--model` and `--forget-model` the refused run
named (a refused run saves no registry):

```sh
gombit db makemigrations reshape_products \
  --allow drop_column:products.title \
  --allow add_not_null
```

`--forget-model` acknowledges the drop of each forgotten model's table, because
dropping it is what the flag asks for. It matches the table by GORM's default
name (`LegacyWidget` → `legacy_widgets`), so a model with a custom `TableName`,
its join tables, or any other dropped table still needs its own `--allow`. It
acknowledges the drop only when the plan creates no table: any table created
in the same plan may be the forgotten model renamed, and the drop would lose
the rows a [table rename](#renaming-a-table) keeps. The plan then suggests the
rename, with the exact command when exactly one new table holds every
non-bookkeeping column of the dropped one with the same type. The first migration in an empty directory only creates
tables, so `makemigrations` skips the plan there. `--rename` generates its own
SQL and does not plan either.

`gombit db plan` exits non-zero while any destructive or unsafe step is
unacknowledged, and `--json` prints the steps for tooling. In CI, run it after
the models change to fail the build on a destructive change nobody signed off
on. Once the acknowledged migration is committed, the models and the migration
directory agree and the plan is empty again. `makemigrations` records each
acknowledged step in the migration it writes as a `-- gombit:allow <id>` line,
so [`gombit db lint`](#linting-and-repairing-the-migration-directory) accepts it
in CI, and a hand-written destructive migration without that line fails.

## Renaming a column

Renaming a model field is a dropped column plus a new column to Atlas, so a
plain `gombit db makemigrations` emits a table rebuild whose `INSERT ... SELECT`
copies every column **except** the renamed one — silent data loss if the new
column is nullable, or a `NOT NULL constraint failed` mid-apply if it isn't
(#299). A drop+add is genuinely ambiguous versus a real drop and a real add, so
the rename has to be stated explicitly:

```sh
gombit db makemigrations rename_guild_title \
  --driver sqlite \
  --rename guilds.name:title
```

`--rename table.old_column:new_column` (repeatable) generates a native,
data-preserving `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN` — supported by SQLite (>= 3.25),
PostgreSQL, and MySQL 8 — instead of the drop+add rebuild. The column keeps its
rows. Rename the field in the model **first** (and run `gombit generate` so the
`*.gen.go` matches), then run the command above; afterwards the model and the
migration history agree, so the next `gombit db makemigrations` reports the
directory synced.

`--rename` is a focused operation: it does not diff models, so it cannot be
combined with `--model`/`--forget-model` in the same call, and it writes only
the rename migration. Make other schema changes in a separate run. Identifiers
must be simple (letters, digits, underscore) — the table/column names GORM
generates.

## Renaming a table

Renaming a model renames its table (`Product` → `products` becomes `Item` →
`items`). To Atlas that is a dropped table plus a new one, and to the registry
it is a model that no longer compiles. `gombit db plan` shows the drop with the
command that keeps the rows:

```sh
gombit db plan --forget-model github.com/acme/shop/internal/product.Product \
  --model github.com/acme/shop/internal/item.Item
```

```text
  DESTRUCTIVE  drop_table:products
               Drops table products and every row in it.
               Table items is created in the same plan with the same columns. If it replaces products, keep the rows with a rename instead:
                 gombit db makemigrations <name> --rename-table products:items --model github.com/acme/shop/internal/item.Item --forget-model github.com/acme/shop/internal/product.Product
```

The supported workflow:

1. Rename the model (and its package, if it moves) and update `AutoMigrate` in
   `internal/platform/database.go` to the new type. Run `gombit generate` so the
   `*.gen.go` match.
2. Write the rename migration and swap the model in the registry:

   ```sh
   gombit db makemigrations rename_products \
     --rename-table products:items \
     --forget-model github.com/acme/shop/internal/product.Product \
     --model github.com/acme/shop/internal/item.Item
   ```

   `--rename-table old:new` (repeatable) writes a native
   `ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO`, which SQLite, PostgreSQL, and MySQL all support,
   and foreign keys in other tables follow the table. With `--rename-table`,
   `--model` and `--forget-model` only update `models.json`; no model diff runs.
   The registry is written after `atlas.sum` is refreshed, and a failed hash
   restores both.
3. Run `gombit db makemigrations sync_items`. GORM names indexes and foreign keys
   after the table (`idx_products_sku` → `idx_items_sku`, `fk_products_owner` →
   `fk_items_owner`), so this migration renames them. The plan reports each as a safe `rename_index` /
   `rename_foreign_key`, because the definition is unchanged and the rows already
   satisfy it, so no `--allow` is needed. Afterwards `gombit db plan` reports no
   changes.
4. `gombit db migrate`.

`--rename-table` and `--rename` can share one run. Table renames apply first,
so a column rename names the table's new name. Chained or swapped table renames
(`a:b` with `b:c`, or `a:b` with `b:a`) are rejected; write them as separate
migrations. `--rename` also accepts `table.old_column=table.new_column`.

A rename migration comes with its exact inverse in
`downs/<version>_<name>.down.sql` (the column renames undone in reverse, then
the table renames), so `gombit db rollback` can undo it.

## Linting and repairing the migration directory

`gombit db lint` checks the migration directory without touching the
application database:

```sh
gombit db lint               # every migration: what CI should run
gombit db lint --json
gombit db lint --latest 1    # only the newest, a local shortcut
```

`lint`, `repair`, and `check` take `--dir` (default `database/migrations`),
`--atlas-bin` (default `atlas`), and `--driver` (default: the configured
driver), which picks the Atlas dev database the migrations are replayed on. For
PostgreSQL and MySQL that dev database runs in Docker ([Drivers](#drivers)).

- **Integrity.** `atlas.sum` matches every file, and the migrations apply to
  an empty dev database (Atlas Community Edition `migrate validate`). A
  mismatch names the changed files and the fix, `gombit db repair`.
- **Layout.** Every `*.sql` file is an up migration; a down file outside
  `downs/` is reported with where it belongs.
- **Safety.** Every migration is classified like
  [`gombit db plan`](#planning-a-change), from the schema before and after it,
  and from its own statements with the fail-safe
  [statement classifier](/guide/migration-safety): `DELETE`, `UPDATE`,
  `TRUNCATE`, an upsert (`INSERT OR REPLACE`, `ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`,
  `ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE`), a `DROP TABLE` the schema does not show (a table dropped and
  re-created), an `ALTER COLUMN ... USING` expression (it rewrites every
  value), an `ALTER COLUMN` with no visible change, and SQL Gombit cannot
  classify are all destructive or unsafe. A statement the schema diff already
  explains does not count twice: the column drop it reports, an `ALTER COLUMN`
  without `USING` whose change the diff classifies, and Atlas's own SQLite
  rebuild (a copy of every surviving stored column into `new_<table>`
  (generated columns are recomputed, not copied), by name or as
  Atlas's `IFNULL(col, <default>) AS col` (a literal, or an expression in
  parentheses), which Atlas writes only for a column that ends up NOT NULL
  with that default after a default or NOT NULL change
  the diff classifies, then the drop and the rename back, as three contiguous
  statements, with the change that caused it in the diff). Each data-changing
  statement is its own step, `data_change:<table>.statement_<n>`, so one
  acknowledgement covers one statement. A destructive or unsafe step passes only when the migration
  carries a line for it:

  ```sql
  -- gombit:allow drop_column:products.price
  ALTER TABLE `products` DROP COLUMN `price`;
  ```

  The line takes a step ID or a code, like `--allow`. `makemigrations` writes
  these lines itself for the steps `--allow` or `--forget-model` acknowledged.
  Renames the migration states (`ALTER TABLE ... RENAME TO`,
  `RENAME COLUMN`, MySQL `RENAME TABLE`) count as safe `rename_table` /
  `rename_column` steps, unless the migration also drops that table, and
  anything else the migration changes is still classified.

`gombit db lint` checks every migration by default and exits non-zero on any
problem, so CI can run it on every pull request. `--latest N` classifies only
the N newest, which saves dev-database starts locally but can miss an older
unacknowledged migration, so don't use it in CI. It does not wrap `atlas migrate lint`, which ADR-012 keeps outside the
Community Edition dependency surface.

After an intentional hand edit to a migration (a backfill, a
`-- gombit:allow` line), restore the directory with gombit alone:

```sh
gombit db repair
```

It rehashes `atlas.sum`, checks that every migration still applies to an empty
dev database, and checks [safety manifests](/guide/migration-safety) against their
SQL. A manifest binds reviewed SQL, so a stale one is reported, and rewritten
only with `gombit db repair --write-manifests` after you review the change.
Atlas errors that `gombit db migrate`, `status`, `makemigrations`, and `hash`
pass through name the gombit command (`gombit db hash`) instead of the Atlas
CLI.

### Rehashing only: `gombit db hash`

```sh
gombit db hash [--dir database/migrations] [--atlas-bin atlas]
```

`gombit db hash` wraps `atlas migrate hash`: it recomputes `atlas.sum` and
nothing else. It does not replay the migrations or check safety manifests, and
it needs no dev database. `gombit db repair` rehashes too and then runs those
checks, so prefer it after a hand edit.

## Checking the whole chain

`gombit db check` runs every schema check in one non-interactive command, for
local development and CI:

```sh
gombit db check                  # every layer, against the configured database
gombit db check --no-db          # a CI job without a database
gombit db check --db-timeout 10s
gombit db check --openapi-url http://127.0.0.1:8080/openapi.json
gombit db check --json
```

It checks each link from the models to the database, in this order, and
reports each one as `ok`, `DRIFT`, `ERROR`, or `skipped`, with the command that
fixes it:

| Layer | Checks | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| generated contract | the `*.gen.go` match the models (`gombit generate --check`) | `gombit generate` |
| model registry | the models `AutoMigrate` lists match `models.json` | `makemigrations --model` / `--forget-model` |
| migration directory | `atlas.sum` matches and every migration applies to an empty dev database; no misplaced files | `gombit db repair` |
| migration safety | every destructive or unsafe change carries a `-- gombit:allow` line ([Linting](#linting-and-repairing-the-migration-directory)) | handle the data, acknowledge it |
| models ↔ migrations | the models declare nothing the migrations lack ([`gombit db plan`](#planning-a-change)) | `gombit db makemigrations` |
| pending migrations | the database has applied every migration | `gombit db migrate` |
| database schema | the database has exactly the schema its applied migrations build | capture the change in a migration |
| TypeScript client | the committed client matches the running app's `/openapi.json` (only with `--openapi-url`) | `gombit client check --write --url ...` |

The **database schema** layer compares `atlas schema inspect` of the
application database with the migration directory inspected at the last
applied version, so it finds what was changed outside a migration: a column
added by hand, an index dropped in a console. Gombit's and Atlas's bookkeeping
tables (and Atlas's own `atlas_schema_revisions` schema, once it holds nothing
else) are the only things set aside. On PostgreSQL a schema is part of what
the migrations build, so a table moved out of `public` or a schema created by
hand is drift (`extra_schema:<name>`, `missing_schema:<name>`). On MySQL the
schema is the database itself, so the application database is compared with
the dev database the migrations replay on whatever each is named. Each difference is listed as a step
ID, like `add_column:products.extra` (the database has a column the migrations
don't create) or `drop_index:products.idx_products_name` (the migrations
create an index the database lacks).

The command exits non-zero when any layer drifts or errors. A clean project
prints the same report every run, ending in `The schema chain is consistent.`
`--no-db` skips the pending-migrations and database-schema layers; without it,
a database that cannot be read within `--db-timeout` (30s by default; `0`
waits indefinitely) is an error, not a skip, so a CI job that forgets its database fails. The
pending-migrations layer also reports a version the database has applied but
the directory no longer has (a migration renamed or deleted after it ran).
While that is so, or while a migration older than the last applied one is
still pending, the database-schema layer is skipped: the directory replayed to
the last applied version is not what the database should have. The migration
ledger and the live schema are separate reads: when the database answers but
`atlas schema inspect` fails (no Atlas CLI, no catalog access), the
database-schema layer reports the error and the pending layer still lists
what is unapplied. A layer that an earlier one makes meaningless is
skipped with the reason (the migrations are not classified while `atlas.sum`
is inconsistent). The command is read-only; on SQLite, opening a database file
that does not exist yet creates it empty, as `gombit db status` does.

## Apply / Status / Rollback

M2-2 adds apply, status, and rollback. These commands read the configured
database from `config.Load()` (`GOMBIT_DATABASE_DRIVER` / `GOMBIT_DATABASE_DSN`)
and the migration directory (default `database/migrations`).

```sh
gombit db migrate [--dir database/migrations] [--atlas-bin atlas]
gombit db status  [--dir database/migrations] [--atlas-bin atlas]
gombit db rollback [--dir database/migrations] [--atlas-bin atlas]
```

### Apply

`gombit db migrate`:

1. Ensures the Gombit revision table `framework_migrations` exists.
2. Runs Atlas Community Edition
   `atlas migrate apply --url ... --dir file://... --allow-dirty`
   (PostgreSQL also passes `--revisions-schema public` so
   `atlas_schema_revisions` is a table in `public`, matching Gombit's ledger
   sync; Atlas's default dedicated revisions schema is not used).
   `--allow-dirty` is required because Gombit creates `framework_migrations`
   before apply, and real apps already have schema tables.
3. Records into `framework_migrations` only the pending versions that appear in
   `atlas_schema_revisions` after apply (`version`, `name`, `batch`,
   `applied_at`; no checksum; D4). This keeps the Gombit ledger aligned with
   Atlas when the two previously diverged.

If nothing is pending relative to `framework_migrations`, migrate prints
`No pending migrations.` and does not invoke Atlas apply.

Unrecognized `*.sql` filenames in the migration directory are skipped with a
warning on stderr.

### Status

`gombit db status` prints Gombit applied/pending rows from the migration
directory plus `framework_migrations`, then runs `atlas migrate status` for
Atlas bookkeeping.

### Rollback

Rollback is Gombit-owned and does **not** wrap `atlas migrate down` (that
command is outside Atlas Community Edition).

`gombit db rollback` rolls back the **latest batch** only:

1. Loads the highest `batch` from `framework_migrations`.
2. Requires a companion down file for every version in that batch (missing
   downs fail before any SQL runs; migrate does not require downs).
3. Executes those down files in reverse version order.
4. Deletes matching rows from `framework_migrations` and
   `atlas_schema_revisions` so a later `gombit db migrate` can re-apply.

On SQLite and PostgreSQL, downs and revision deletes run in one transaction:
a mid-batch failure aborts the transaction and leaves revision rows unchanged.
MySQL DDL often auto-commits, so a mid-batch failure can leave the schema
partially rolled back while revision rows remain; the error lists completed
downs and revision rows are only removed after every down succeeds.

### Down files

Atlas writes up migrations such as:

```text
database/migrations/20260101000000_create_products.sql
```

Gombit-owned down SQL lives in a subdirectory so Atlas never scans it (Atlas
panics if `.down.sql` files sit beside versioned up migrations):

```text
database/migrations/downs/20260101000000_create_products.down.sql
```

If any down file in the latest batch is missing, rollback fails before
executing any down SQL. Migrate does not require downs.

## Seed / Reset

M2-3 adds seeders and a destructive development reset. Both commands read the
configured database from `config.Load()` (`GOMBIT_DATABASE_DRIVER` /
`GOMBIT_DATABASE_DSN`).

```sh
gombit db seed  [--seeds database/seeds]
gombit db reset [--dir database/migrations] [--seeds database/seeds] [--atlas-bin atlas] [--force]
```

### Seed

`gombit db seed` executes every top-level `*.sql` file in the seed directory in
lexical order. Nested subdirectories and non-`.sql` files are skipped with a
warning on stderr. A missing or empty seed directory prints `No seed files.` and
exits successfully.

Each seed file may contain multiple SQL statements separated by `;`. Gombit
splits on semicolons outside single/double quotes and `--` / `/* */` comments,
then executes statements in order (so multi-`INSERT` files work without relying
on driver multi-statement support). **Known limit (v0.1):** the splitter does
not treat MySQL backtick identifiers (`` `ident` ``) or PostgreSQL dollar-quoted
strings (`$tag$...$tag$`) as quoted regions — a `;` inside those forms can
mis-split. Prefer one statement per file, or avoid semicolons inside backticks /
dollar-quotes, until the splitter is extended.

Seed files are application-owned SQL. Keep them idempotent if you plan to run
`seed` more than once against the same database; Gombit does not wrap seeds in a
cross-driver transaction.

Example layout (flat directory only):

```text
database/seeds/01_demo.sql
database/seeds/02_more_data.sql
```

### Reset

`gombit db reset` is drop + migrate + seed:

1. Wipes the configured database using the driver strategy below (including
   Gombit/Atlas revision tables when they live in the wiped scope).
2. Runs `gombit db migrate`.
3. Runs `gombit db seed`.

Driver wipe strategy:

| Driver | Wipe |
| --- | --- |
| SQLite | `DROP` every non-`sqlite_*` table/view from `sqlite_master` (file is not deleted) |
| PostgreSQL | Resets schema `public` only (`DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE` then recreate + grants). Non-`public` schemas are left untouched. |
| MySQL | Disable FK checks, drop every base table/view in the current database, re-enable checks |

Reset refuses to run when `GOMBIT_ENV=production` unless `--force` is set.
Seed alone is allowed in production; apps own seed idempotency.

## Revision metadata

| Column | Notes |
| --- | --- |
| `version` | Atlas migration version prefix |
| `name` | Migration name suffix |
| `batch` | Incremented once per successful migrate that applies files |
| `applied_at` | UTC timestamp when the batch was recorded |

Atlas may still maintain `atlas.sum` and `atlas_schema_revisions` for apply
integrity. That is separate from D4: Gombit does not store checksums in
`framework_migrations`.

## Drivers

`--driver` (`makemigrations`, `plan`, `lint`, `repair`, `check`) accepts the
supported database drivers:

| Driver | Atlas dev database |
| --- | --- |
| `sqlite` | `sqlite://file?mode=memory&_fk=1` |
| `postgres` | `docker://postgres/15/dev?search_path=public` |
| `mysql` | `docker://mysql/8/dev` |

SQLite runs without Docker. PostgreSQL and MySQL use Atlas dev-database Docker
URLs, so Docker must be available to generate, plan, lint, repair, or check
migrations for those drivers.

Apply/status convert the configured GORM DSN into an Atlas `--url` for the
same three drivers. Libpq keyword/value DSNs with a slash-prefixed `host`
become a unix-socket URI (`postgres://user@/dbname?host=/path/to/sockets`);
IPv6 hosts are bracketed (`[::1]:5432`). SQLite `file:///abs/path` maps to
`sqlite:///abs/path` (three slashes), not four.

## Model Registration

M2-1 keeps model enumeration explicit: pass feature package models from
`internal/<feature>` with `--model` flags, one per `gombit db makemigrations`
call for whatever's new. `database/migrations/models.json` is the persisted
registry of every model named so far (see [Generate A
Migration](#generate-a-migration)) — you don't repeat earlier ones.

The model spec format is:

```text
<go import path>.<exported model type>
```

For example:

```text
github.com/acme/shop/internal/product.Product
```

The repository example model can be passed with:

```sh
gombit db makemigrations create_products \
  --driver sqlite \
  --model github.com/gombit-dev/gombit/examples/migrations/internal/product.Product
```

This explicit list is the Program Mode equivalent of importing each feature
package and passing concrete model values to Atlas. It avoids runtime
reflection discovery and keeps the loader reviewable.

## Multi-DB Conformance

M2-4 gates official SQLite / PostgreSQL / MySQL support with a conformance
matrix that applies Atlas-generated migrations and exercises CRUD, transactions,
timestamps, nullable/unique/index columns, decimal, pagination, and migrate
up/down. See [`docs/database.md`](/guide/database#conformance-m2-4).
